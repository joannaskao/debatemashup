Debatify
============
Remix the second U.S. presidential debate! Just type the letters on the soundboard with your keyboard to turn debate sound bites and highlights into song lyrics and musical hooks. Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have never sounded so good!

This project (running on Django) is the result of a [HacksHackers Boston presidential debates hackathon](http://meetupbos.hackshackers.com/events/84502712/) on October 19-20, 2012.
A working copy of this project can be found at [http://debatify.herokuapp.com/](http://debatify.herokuapp.com/).
